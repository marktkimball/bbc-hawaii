      We sing hymns, pray together, have a message from the Bible, ask & answer
      questions. We spend time together afterwards. Our get-togethers usually

    lead: How should I dress?
    text: >
      Many people come dressed in nice Hawaiian attrive as if you were visiting
      a nice restaurant. But we would be happy for you to visit us whether you
      dress this way or not. We'd like to not be overly formal, but certainly
      modest and respectful to the Lord and his people.

    text: >
      At the moment, we do not. As our gathering grows, we will try to provide
      nursery for babies and toddlers. We love children here, so don't be shy
      about bringing your whole family!
