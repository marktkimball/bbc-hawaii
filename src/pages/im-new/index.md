      After languishing for nearly a year looking for a property, the Lord has
      just given us our very own church building located at 455 Kilani Ave. in
      Wahiawa across from Zippys, very near Tamuras Grocery store.

    lead: Should I bring my Bible?
    text: >
      We encourage everyone to bring a Bible and follow along. Feel free to ask
      questions. If you do not have a Bible, we will provide one on request
      while supplies last.

    lead: What's the gathering like?
    text: >
      We sing hymns, pray together, have a message from the Bible, ask & answer
      questions. We spend time together afterwards. Our services usually last
      about 1 hour 15 minutes, sometimes a little longer when the preacher is
      really excited!

    lead: How should I dress?
    text: >
      Many people come dressed in nice Hawaiian attire as if you were visiting a
      nice restaurant. But we would be happy for you to visit us whether you
      dress this way or not. We'd like to not be overly formal, but certainly
      modest and respectful to the Lord and his people. The idea is simple: the
      Lord gave us his best & so we think it befitting to give him our best. If
      your best is the widows two mites, you can rest assured it will please the
      Lord very much! That's all that matters!

    lead: Do you have a nursery?
    text: >
      Yes we do. It is not as perfect as we want it to be yet, but it is clean &
      safe. As our church grows, we want things to become as good as they can.
      Jesus loves the little children & said, "Suffer the little children to
      come unto me and forbid them not", so don't be shy about bringing your
      whole family! If you have concerns, give us a call!

We are very happy that you are interested in joining us on Sunday! We are looking forward to meeting you. Below you will find helpful information about us. Please be aware that our church is very young but growing. Church is not "us" the staff and "you" the customer. We see church as a family of people labouring & sacrificing together to build the work of God together. We are mere sinners saved by grace but we will do our best as often as we can to make you comfortable and welcome. Hope to see you soon! Call or text (almost) any time!
