    lead: When do you meet?
    text: >
      There are lots of ways for you to join in on one of our services. With
      multiple service times throughout the week, we want you to have as much of
      an opportunity as possible to be a part. On Sundays, we have our morning
      worship service at 11am. Prior to the service, there is a Bible study hour
      beginning at 10am. The Sunday evening service begins at 6pm. We also have
      a midweek Bible study on Wednesdays at 7pm.

      Our address is: 6526 Guinea Pike, Loveland, Ohio 45140. We have a main
      entrance at the front of the building that takes you straight into the
      main auditorium. There are greeters available to answer any questions you
      might have. Feel free to say good morning, take a bulletin, and have a
      seat. If you are coming for a Sunday School class, ask a greeter where the
      class is taking place and they will help you along. If you don't know what
      class to go to, no worries, come into the main auditorium and have a seat
      for our Pastor’s Bible study. You will be filled with the Word!

    lead: Should I bring my Bible?

      We encourage everyone to bring their Bibles and follow along with the
      Pastor’s message. If you do not have a Bible, we will provide one on
      request.

    lead: How should I dress?
    text: >
      At Branch Hill Baptist Church, we want you to come in modest attire. Our
      ministry leaders and many in our church family dress in more traditional
      “Sunday” dress; however, our main goal is that you would feel welcome and
      comfortable on your visit.

    lead: Do you have a nursery?
    text: >
      We do have a nursery available for children up to age 2. The nursery is
      highly staffed and available for Sunday Bible classes and the main
      service. There is no nursery available on Sunday evening or Wednesday
      evening. If you wish to keep your child with you during the service,
      please feel free to do so. There is a foyer area should you need to sneak
      out for a moment for any reason with your little ones.

At Branch Hill Baptist Church we want to make sure our guests feel welcome and know what to expect when they walk through our doors. We know there may be many questions you have such as, which door do I come in, is there a nursery for all services, what kind of music can I expect? Let us take a couple moments and fill you in so you can feel completely at ease when you enter our church home.
