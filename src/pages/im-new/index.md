    lead: How should I dress?
    text: >
      At Bible Baptist Church, we want you to come in modest attire. Our
      ministry leaders and many in our church family dress in more traditional
      “Sunday” dress; however, our main goal is that you would feel welcome and
      comfortable on your visit.

      At the moment, we do not. As the church grows we will provide nursery for babies and toddlers. We love children in the services, so don't be shy about bringing your whole family!
