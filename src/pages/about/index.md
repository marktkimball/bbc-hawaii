After serving nearly 3 decades in Germany, we've come to Oahu to seek the Lord's face in starting a church. We believe the Lord will set in this body whom He chooses. We are looking forward to seeing the Lord build His church as he promised. If you're hungry for the truth of the Scriptures and a good group of people to fellowship with, why don't you come by for a visit and enjoy some time with us...
