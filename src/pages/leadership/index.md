## From the Pastor

My wife, Sonya, and I are glad you stopped by the website. We have designed it with you in mind, hoping it will be a source of spiritual insight and benefit—but then again, that's the focus of our church. We came to Branch Hill in February of 1987, a young and excited couple seeking to serve the Lord and be a blessing to people. It's sort of ironic that I pastor the church, since I attended this church from age 12 through my teen years. I left seeking fun, friends, and pleasure, but after a few years away from the Lord, I returned with a wife and a will to minister the Word of God that had ministered to me during some very difficult times. Although I was saved at the early age of six, I had never discovered the fellowship and joy one can have with the Lord through the pages of the Bible. It had been to me much like it is to many Christians…a closed book. Yet in the dark days of emotional distress and depression, I found a comfort in the Word of God that I had always heard about but never experienced. It was this experience that has molded the focus of my ministry and, thus, the focus of our church—growing in grace and in our walk with Jesus Christ through the Word of God. We still believe people would like to understand the Bible, but many have become disillusioned.

We are a church that believes the Bible, loves the Bible, reads and studies the Bible. We have found a fellowship and unity that is supernaturally produced by that fellowship. It is what the Apostle Paul called the "fellowship of the gospel." We would love to have you visit and find out what THE BOOK is all about. We don't care a lot for religion, but we love the Lord and enjoy learning more about Him through the pages of his Word. After all, it was Jesus who said, "Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls." We hope you come out and discover what that rest is all about!

If you find you are looking for a group of people that are more like family, or ir you need someone to talk to about questions you have about life, challenges, or other concerns, we want to be there for you. Please feel free to contact us any time and let us know how we can help.
