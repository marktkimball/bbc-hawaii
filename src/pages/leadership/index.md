      Pastor & Mrs. Angie are happy to be starting a church here in Oahu. If you
      like tell-it-like-it-is, plain Bible teaching and preaching, we might have
      the church for you.â€‹

# Why we're here

The Bible is the most printed, most read, most regarded book ... EVER. That's not without reason. Each generation, each neighborhood deserves the opportunity to get to know that Book in detail. Unfortunately, many if not most churches today have devolved into a social club where the Bible is the least important thing. It's our joy to be here. It would be our joy to introduce you to a deeper understanding of God's word. Email, text or call us if we can help you with spiritual matters or if you'd like to come for a visit, our doors are open to anyone who is earnestly seeking the truth, the Lord Jesus, his Word &/or a good fellowship with while we serve him together.
