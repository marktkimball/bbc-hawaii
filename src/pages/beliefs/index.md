## The Bible

​​We believe the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament to be the inspired word of God, the final authority for faith, life and church establishment, inerrant in the original writings, and preserved without error in the English King James Bible. 2 Tim. 3:16, 2 Pet. 1:20-21, Psa. 12:6-7, Lk. 21:33, Isa. 8:20.

## God & the Trinity

​We believe in one triune God, eternally existing in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, co-eternal in being, co-identical in nature, co-equal in power and glory, having the same attributes and perfections. ​Deut. 6:4, 2 Cor. 13:14.

We believe the Father is the one and living God; an infinite and intelligent Spirit. Ex. 20:2-3, Jn. 4:24.

We believe on the Lord Jesus Christ who is the Son of God and God the Son. We believe in his pre-incarnate deity – Jn. 1:1, virgin birth – Lk. 1:35, sinless life – Heb. 4:15, substitutionary death - 2 Cor. 5:21, bodily resurrection - Acts 1:3, ascension - Acts 1:9-11, priesthood – Heb. 2:11, imminent pre-tribulation coming of Christ for his saints - 1 Thess. 4:13-18, 1 Cor. 15:51-58, pre-millennial coming of Christ with his saints to set up his kingdom on earth – Rev. 19.

We believe that the Spirit is a divine Person equal with the Father and the Son - Mt. 28:19. He convicts of sin, righteousness and judgment – Jn. 16:8-11; comforts – Jn. 14:16-11; witnesses - Rom 8:16, and sanctifies - 1 Pet. 1:2.​

## Salvation

We believe in the blood atonement of Jesus Christ for sin - 1 Jn. 1:1, Col 1:14, 1 Pet. 1:18-19.

We believe in the voluntary fall of man resulting in the spiritual death, guilt, and fall of the race of Adam. Gen. 3, Rom. 5, Eph. 2:1-3.

We believe that salvation is by grace through faith in Jesus Christ. Eph. 2:8-9, Jn. 1:12, 3:16, Acts 20:24, 13:38-39, 15:9-11.

​We believe in the eternal security and assurance of believers. Once saved, we are kept by God's power and are secure in Christ forever. Jn. 6:37, 10:27-30, Eph. 1:13, 4:30. 1 Jn. 5:11-13.

## The Church

We believe in the unity of all true believers, which is the body of Christ. 1 Cor. 12:12-14, 2 Cor. 11:2, Eph. 1:22-23, 5:25-27.

We believe in the local church as an assembly of baptized believers gathered together for the purpose of performing the Great Commission. Mt. 28:18-20, Acts 1:8-9, Eph. 5:25, 1 Tim. 3:15, Rom 1:14-16.

​We believe that the ordinances of the local church are baptism and the Lord's supper. Baptism: the only biblical mode of believer's baptism is by total immersion in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit by the command of God - Mt. 28:19, and is a figure of the death, burial, and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ. 1 Pet. 3:21, 1 Cor. 15:1-4. Lord's Supper: the commemoration of our Lord's death by the bread and the fruit of the vine is always preceded by self-examination. 1 Cor. 11:23-28.

## Creation

We believe in the Genesis account of the direct creation of the universe and man by God, not by the process of evolution. Gen. 1:1, Psa. 8:3, 19:1, Jn. 1:9-10, Rev. 4:11, 14:6-1.

We believe in the existence of Satan who was once a sinless being but fell by pride. Isa. 14:12-14, Eze. 28:12-18.

## Eternity

We believe in eternal bliss in heaven for all who are saved through Christ's shed blood. We believe in a literal hell and eternal damnation in the lake of fire for all who are lost. Rev. 20:11-15, Mk. 9:43-48, Lk. 16, Isa. 66.

## Miscellaneous

We do not accept any form of the Ecumenical or charismatic movement of this day. 2 Cor. 6:14-11, Amos 3:3, 1 Tim. 4:13, 1 Cor. 13:8, 2 Cor. 12:12, 11:4, 13-15, 2 Thess. 2:9.

We are not Calvinists in any point.

We do not listen to, sell, or advocate Contemporary Christian music (CCM).
