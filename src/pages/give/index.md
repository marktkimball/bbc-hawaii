Whether you’re giving your tithes or just simply giving a love offering, you can do it online!

Invest in God’s work and be a part of reaching this nation and world by supporting Bible Baptist Church and its ministries.

Bible Baptist Church has online giving available to those who desire to use it. There are many benefits to giving online:

- Users of online giving are responsible for setting up and controlling their online giving options themselves.
- They can designate where their giving goes (general fund, building program, missions, etc.) and the frequency in which they give.
- Online giving is secure and tax deductible.
- Online giving allows you to set up your giving using either a debit or credit card or an automatic bank draft to your account.

You are free to give via the weekly offering during the worship service, by mailing your contribution in to the office, or online. We welcome you to give whatever God has called you to and however God has called you to do so.

II Corinthians 9:7 reads, _“Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.”_
